    The requested resource was modified during the request and could therefore

    Raised when a server responds with another block2 than expected.

class MissingBlock2Option(Error):
    """

class NotObservable(Error):
    """
    The server did not accept the request to observe the resource.

    An incoming message does not look like CoAP.
