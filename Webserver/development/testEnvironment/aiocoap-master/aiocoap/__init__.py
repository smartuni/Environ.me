aiocoap
=======

The aiocoap package is a library that implements CoAP, the Constrained
Application Protocol (`RFC 7252`_, more info at http://coap.technology/).

.. _`RFC 7252`: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252

Usage
-----

In all but the most exotic applications, you will want to create a single
:class:`.Context` instance that binds to the network. The
:meth:`.Context.create_client_context` and
:meth:`.Context.create_server_context` coroutines give you a readily connected
context.

On the client side, you can request resources by assembling a :class:`.Message`
and passing it to your context's :meth:`.Context.request` method, which
returns a :class:`.protocol.Request` object with a
:attr:`.protocol.Request.response` future (which is a :class:`.Message` again).

On the server side, a resource tree gets built from
:class:`aiocoap.resource.Resource` objects into a
:class:`aiocoap.resource.Site`, which is assigned to the context at creation
time.
