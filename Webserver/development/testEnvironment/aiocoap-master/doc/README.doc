in order to have auto-buildable documentation with sphinx (using `./setup.py
build_sphinx`), you must first run

    for x in $(find aiocoap -name '*.py' | sed -e 's@.py$@@' -e 's@/__init__$@@' -e 's@/@.@g')
    do
        rm doc/$x.rst
        echo "$x module\n=========================================\n\n.. automodule:: $x" > doc/$x.rst
        if [[ $x != "aiocoap.numbers" ]]
        then
           echo "    :members:\n    :undoc-members:\n    :show-inheritance:" >> doc/$x.rst
        else
           echo ".. toctree::\n    :glob:\n\n    aiocoap.numbers.*\n" >> doc/$x.rst
        fi
    done

(sphinx-apidoc is less customizable and does not seem to do more).

for readthedocs to work, a branch `for-readthedocs` has been generated that
contains those files statically checked in.
