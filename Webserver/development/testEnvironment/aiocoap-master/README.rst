aiocoap -- The Python CoAP library
==================================

The aiocoap package is a Python implementation of CoAP, the Constrained
Application Protocol (`RFC 7252`_, more info at http://coap.technology/).

It uses the asyncio module introduced in Python 3.4 to facilitate concurrent
operations while maintaining a simple to use interface and not depending on
anything outside the standard library.

aiocoap is originally based on txThings_. If you want to use CoAP in your
existing twisted application, or can not migrate to Python 3 yet, that is
probably more useful to you than aiocoap.

.. _`RFC 7252`: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252

Usage
-----

For details on how to use the aiocoap library, have a look at the :mod:`aiocoap`
module documentation, or at the :doc:`examples` and :doc:`tools` provided.

All examples can be run directly from a source code copy. If you prefer to
install it, the usual Python mechanisms apply.

Dependencies
------------

The core aiocoap functionality works out of the box with Python_ 3.4; with the
additional asyncio_ module, it works with version 3.3 as well.

When application/link-format typed resources (`RFC 6690`_) are supposed to be
used, the `link_header`_ module is required as well. When the respective code
paths are used without the module, an `ImportError` will be raised, or a `5.00`
status code will be returned.

Development
-----------

aiocoap tries to stay close to PEP8_ recommendations and general best practice,
and should thus be easy to contribute to. Unit tests are implemented in the
``./tests/`` directory; complete test coverage is aimed for, but not yet
complete (and might never be, as the error handling for pathological network
partners is hard to trigger with a library designed not to misbehave).

Documentation is built using sphinx_; hacks used there are described in
``./doc/README.doc``.

Bugs from design goal and wishlist to typos are currently tracked in github
(see below).
